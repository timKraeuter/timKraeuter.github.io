Since no gymnast from my club, including me, knew how to calculate his difficulty score, I made an app that does it for you.

Example of the app - Smart CoP - calculating the difficulty of a floor exercise.

![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/timKraeuter/timKraeuter.github.io/master/assets/images/screenshot.jpg)

It is an app to calculate your gymnastics difficulty. You select the elements of your exercise and the app automatically calculates the difficulty score.

What can it do?

- Calculate your difficulty by providing all elements from the code of points.
- Saves your exercises in the app automatically.
- Not cost you anything or annoy you with advertisements.
- Export your exercise to a beautiful pdf, as seen [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1vzjhyJnCMgtyz4uOayX06g2zH5qw2dRP).
- Import the created pdf files back into the app, so you can share and collaborate with your fellow gymnast friends.

Have a look at my tutorial page in [english](https://timkraeuter.github.io/SmartCoP-tutorial-en/) and [german](https://timkraeuter.github.io/SmartCoP-tutorial-de/).

After 5 years and over 500+ downloads, I have unpublished the app.

![Overview of the App showing downloads](./https://raw.githubusercontent.com/timKraeuter/timKraeuter.github.io/master/assets/images/smartCoP/installs.png)

I am not competing in gymnastics at the moment and the app is not up to date anymore (since 2025) due to the new regulations.
If anyone wants to pick up the development of the app feel free to reach out to me.

The following graph shows the active installs of the app from 2020-2025, when the app was unpublished.
I only marketed the app once which resulted in an [article](./https://raw.githubusercontent.com/timKraeuter/timKraeuter.github.io/master/assets/images/smartCoP/LEON_article.pdf) in the german gymnastics magazin Leon.
