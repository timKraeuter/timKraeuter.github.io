Since no gymnast from my club, including me, knew how to calculate his difficulty score, I made an app that does it for you.

Example of the app - Smart CoP - calculating the difficulty of a floor exercise.

![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/timKraeuter/timKraeuter.github.io/master/assets/screenshot.jpg)

It is an app to calculate your gymnastics difficulty. You select the elements of your exercise and the app automatically calculates the difficulty score.

What can it do?

- Calculate your difficulty by providing all elements from the code of points.
- Saves your exercises in the app automatically.
- Not cost you anything or annoy you with advertisements.
- Export your exercise to a beautiful pdf, as seen [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1vzjhyJnCMgtyz4uOayX06g2zH5qw2dRP).
- Import the created pdf files back into the app, so you can share and collaborate with your fellow gymnast friends.

Have a look at my tutorial page in [english](https://timkraeuter.github.io/autoD-tutorial-en/) and [german](https://timkraeuter.github.io/autoD-tutorial-de/).
