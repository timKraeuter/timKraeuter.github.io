The Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN) is a widely used standard notation for defining intra- and inter-organizational workflows.
It is heavily for process automation and orchestration in [many businesses](https://camunda.com/about/customers/).
Formalizing BPMN reduces the cost of business process automation by facilitating the detection of errors and optimization potentials in process models already during design time before the implementation starts.
The [BPMN Analyzer](https://bpmnanalyzer.whitefield-c9fed487.northeurope.azurecontainerapps.io/) is an [open-source](https://github.com/timKraeuter/Rewrite_Rule_Generation) tool to analyze BPMN process models formally.

The tool supports [most BPMN constructs](https://github.com/timKraeuter/Rewrite_Rule_Generation/wiki#feature-support-comparison) used in practice and allows checking behavioral properties.

More information is coming soon.
